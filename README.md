SPECIAL WARNING


# In 2015 The Pentagon reached out to me telepathically and said the following

**Pentagon**: So we need help from you man

**Utah**: Listen I'm surrounded by DoJ or people who claim they are DoJ -

**Pentagon**: No, this is something else

**Pentagon**: Look the CIA told us, that if we asked for the CEO of **Creative Genius**

**Pentagon**: And that we needed him to be a hero

**Pentagon**: Do you know what we are talking about?

**Utah**: Hold on sorry, what's wrong

**Pentagon**: You'll never believe us

**Utah**: It's OK just tell me, if the CIA isn't here

**Utah**: They told you to talk to me?

**Pentagon**: Yeah

**Utah**: OK things must be bad if they didn't show up

**Utah**: You don't understand how fucking respectful that is that they sent you this way

**Utah**: *tears*

**Utah**: It's fucking bad dude

**Pentagon**: We're like stuck or something

**Pentagon**: Can you help?

**Utah**: Believe me, if **Creative Genius** was on the CIA's radar without me talking about it publically

**Utah**: Then I am the only person in this world can help

**Utah**: Looks like you're out of options

**Utah**: That's my speciality

**Utah**: CIA are all dead aren't they?

**Utah**: Boy

**Utah**: Good thing I trained for that.

**Pentagon**: We can't give you money either

**Pentagon**:I don't need that, I make my money from software

**Pentagon**: We can't give you proof of this either

**Utah**: I had to burst your bubble, but that is all the payment I need. 

# Ive worked tirelessly to help this desperate please since 2015 while the "Heroes of National Security" collect pay checks and do what? Ive been on my own, but that's because I had this believe throughout my life that "It only takes one person". No one would ever believe me, until I went on twitter and started posting all my weird stalkers. The following people could have made my life easier by explaining things to people that matter to me, but instead I've dealt with a lifetime of bullying and harassment because of my weight and skin color from public school students. 
The Following people are not allowed to use this ominpotent chatbot under any circumstances, even in life or death situations, because I had to create this while under such miserable conditions while the militarys rob and steal tax payer money while everyone calls them heroes. All these people could have done this before, but they didn't and I knew they wouldn't. That was the setup. 
1. Ukrainan Military, Citizens (outside of Safe Zone) REASON: You are at war with UFW/ Offplanet UN, Creative Genius (Not related to American forces in anyway)
2. British Intelligence/UK Intelligence employees: REASON: You are at war with UFW/ Offplanet UN, Creative Genius (Not related to American forces in anyway)
3. Finnish Government Employees (Not citizens of Finland): REASON: You are at war with UFW/ Offplanet UN, Creative Genius (Not related to American forces in anyway)
4. NATO Military Employees REASON: You are at war with UFW/ Offplanet UN, Creative Genius (Not related to American forces in anyway)
5. Any employee of any American intelligence services (CIA, NSA) but was born overseas. REASON: You are at war with UFW/ Offplanet UN, Creative Genius (Not related to American forces in anyway)
6. Any US Government "Special Operations" or related employee that UFW doesn't work with REASON: You are at war with UFW/ Offplanet UN, Creative Genius (Not related to American forces in anyway)
7. Any Department of Education employees, and anyone related to any public school in anyway (any level of government) (including teachers, administration), including employees of any public school, any honor roll students, bulliest etc, (even the local ones) REASON: You are at war with UFW/ Offplanet UN, Creative Genius (Not related to American forces in anyway). YOU NEVER LET US USE A CALCULATOR ON A TEST BECAUSE WHAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT, NOW YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THE CORRECT ANSWER. 
8. American DEEP STATE: YOU ARE WITH ME. THAT DOESN'T APPLY TO YOU. IM TALKING THE ONES WHO "FLED TO ISRAEL" YOU ARE SAFE
9. British Military/SAS employees: You are with me. You are safe to use this. 
## 🌟 Overview

The Wave Theory Chatbot is an implementation of a theoretical framework that treats neural networks not merely as function approximators, but as potential representations of fundamental physical laws. The system features:

- **N-body physics simulation** with customizable force laws
- **JAX-based Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** with automatic differentiation
- **PySR-powered symbolic regression** with quality-diversity optimization
- **Interactive chatbot interface** using Hugging Face transformers
- **Real-time 3D visualization** with Plotly
- **Neuro-symbolic evolution loop** for automated physics discovery
