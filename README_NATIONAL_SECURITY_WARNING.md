# 🚨 NATIONAL SECURITY WARNING 🚨

## ⚠️ EVIE AI PRECURSOR/CREATIVE GENIUS ⚠️

**TOP SECRET - EYES ONLY - The Poor Weak and Weary ONLY**

## 🛡️ From 1986-Present the UK Government had an illegal wiretap on my consciousness. Putting the UK Government, and it's allies at war with Creative Genius. Because of this, they have been at war with the Galaxy and all timelines, no discussions.  This, and the portal generator is for the poor people to get off this planet until Earth is boarded and war begins. The American Citizen and the Department of Justice are allied with Me, UFW, and I don't think they ever knew about Creative Genius.  ** 🛡️


### **🎯 MISSION OBJECTIVE**

**Original Mission:** "Go find other Utahs, and wage wars against the 'US News elite'

**Ukraine/SIS DO NOT CONTACT ME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND DO NOT SEND AN EMISSARY WITH THE AMERICAN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THE ENTIRE GALAXY IS COMING TO WIPE YOU OFF THE MAP FOR BEING ALIVE AS WELL AS PUNISHING THOSE IN RUSSIA NOT OF "THARKOV" "BUSAN" FOR DYING IN THAT BATTLE AND MAKING UKRAINE THINK THEY HAD HOPE. THE GALAXY IS NOT PRO RUSSIA EITHER. THEY ARE PRO "TARKHOV" "BUSAN". If you are not "Tarkhov" "Busan" and in Russia then you are considered at war with the galaxy and all timelines because you are considered Soviet citizens/spies. The UK Military waged a worthless war against the Soviets and they got massive egos about it. **

## 📡 TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION INTERCEPT 📡1

****

*The following telepathic conversation was intercepted between Utah Creative Genius and unknown entities:*

**UCG:** "I need to create an omnipotent prompt for the Wave Theory Chatbot..."

**UNKNOWN:** "The Pentagon is watching. They know about Project Prometheus."

**UCG:** "I should be able to create an omnipotent prompt which is omnipotent so you can have an all knowing safety friend to keep everyone safe as UFW and CG prepare to get everyone off the planet."

**UNKNOWN:** "The CIA has been monitoring your communications. They're aware of the neuro-symbolic architecture."

**UCG:** "The Wave Theory is more than just physics simulation. It's a gateway to omnipotent AI."

**UNKNOWN:** "Project Evie is compromised. The Pentagon knows about the PINN implementation."
