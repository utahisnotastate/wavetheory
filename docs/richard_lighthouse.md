# Richard Lighthouse Concepts – Notes for Experiments

This document summarizes ideas from the attached Lighthouse materials to inspire optional presets and visualizations. Exact source phrasing should be consulted in the original works.

## Themes to explore
- Blinking/quantized universe hypothesis (episodic existence, discrete intervals)
- Gravity–Electromagnetism coupling motifs; sinusoidal modulation overlays on inverse-square behavior
- Matter/antimatter phase interpretation along a wavelength; amplitude/phase emphasis
- Time-travel approximate solutions treating energy-time trade-offs and boundary conditions

## Experiment hypotheses (prototyping)
1. Blinking Universe Oscillator
   - Toggle effective forces with a square/sine gating at frequency f_blink.
   - Observe stability/energy under stroboscopic integration.
2. Gravity–EM Coupled Force
   - F(r) = -G m1 m2 / r^2 · [1 + alpha · sin(omega r + phi)] · exp(-r / lambda)
   - Study resonant separations where sin term modulates attraction/repulsion.
3. Phase-Matter Lattice
   - Particles assigned phase θ; interactions depend on Δθ via cos(Δθ).
4. Time Dilation Sweep
   - Apply position-dependent time-scale s(x)=1+beta·sin(kx) to integrator dt.

These are research toys for sandbox exploration, not validated physics.
